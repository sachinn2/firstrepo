        Grand Theft Auto V is an action-adventure game played from either a third-person or first-person perspective. Players complete missions—linear scenarios with set objectives—to progress through the story.
        Outside of the missions, players may freely roam the open world.
        The goal in this game is to earn money, build up your reputation, and become the leader of your criminal organization.
        Here, players have the freedom to roam the streets while completing missions, special heists, and other events.
